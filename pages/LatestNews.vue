    Going Green

    Solar energy is a natural form of energy which does not contribute to global warming. Unlike fossil fuels, solar
    panels don't release any greenhouse gases, carcinogens, carbon dioxide or other poisonous gases. Eendag Meule is one
    of few mills in Africa making use of solar power.

    Automatic bag placing system

    Eendag Meule recently installed a Westweigh Systems fully automatic Premiertech Chronos bag placing system. This makes us the first mill in South Africa to install such a bagging system. The system consists of integrated dual head screw fed bagging scales, a Fuji robotic palletizer and semi-automatic pallet handling and wrapper system.

    With unrivalled speed and reliability, Westweigh Systems provides a peace of mind packing solution to continuously pack our maize meal.  E-Milling strives to provide fast, quality service to our customers. With packing speeds of 20 bags/min for 10kg and 12.5kg, up to 18 bags per minute for 25kg and 10 bags/min on 50kg; we are able to achieve that.

    At Eendag Meule Bothaville (Pty) Ltd, we believe in finding the balance between technology and manual labour. With world class technology and a group of 118 full time employees, we reap the reward of a positive work ethic.

    We believe that Eendag Meule has a success recipe which benefits our community, our customers, our nation and surrounding countries.
